non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent

3. Open Source Materials, Other Licenses

Example code made publicly available by Leap Motion on its developer web site is provided subject to the Apache 2.0 license, unless otherwise noted in the license, notice or readme files distributed with the example or in related documentation. The SDK may otherwise include software or other materials that are provided under a separate license agreement, and that separate license will govern the use of such software or other materials in the event of a conflict with this Agreement. Any such separate license agreement may be indicated in the license, notice, or readme files distributed with the applicable software or other materials or in related documentation.

4. No High Risk Use; Acknowledgment and Waiver

4.1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, you are not licensed to, and you agree not to, use, copy, sell, offer for sale, or distribute the SDK, Leap Motion Devices, Leap Motion Software or Leap Motion Redistributables (whether compiled with, incorporated into, or packaged with your Application or otherwise), for or in connection with uses where failure or fault of the Leap Motion Device, Leap Motion Software, Leap Motion Redistributables or your Application could lead to death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to severe physical or environmental damage (“High Risk Use”). ANY SUCH USE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

4.2. You acknowledge the SDK may allow you to develop Applications that enable the control of motorized or mechanical equipment, or other systems, machines or devices. If you elect to use the SDK in such a way, you must take steps to design and test your Applications to ensure that your Applications do not present risks of personal injury or death, property damage, or other losses. The Leap Motion Device, the Leap Motion Software, the Leap Motion Redistributables and other software in the SDK may not always function as intended. You must design your Applications so that any failure of a Leap Motion Device, the Leap Motion Software, a Leap Motion Redistributable and/or such other software does not cause personal injury or death, property damage, or other losses. If you choose to use the SDK, (i) you assume all risk that use of the Leap Motion Device, the Leap Motion Software, the Leap Motion Redistributables and/or such other software by you or by any others causes any harm or loss, including to the end users of your Applications or to third parties, (ii) you hereby waive, on behalf of yourself and your Authorized Users, all claims against Leap Motion and its affiliates related to such use, harm or loss (including, but not limited to, any claim that a Leap Motion Device, the Leap Motion Software, a Leap Motion Redistributable or such other software is defective), and (iii) you agree to hold Leap Motion and its affiliates harmless from such claims.
5. Confidentiality and Privacy

8. Agreement and Development Program

We reserve the right to change this Agreement, the SDK or the Leap Motion development and licensing program at any time in our discretion. Leap Motion may require that you either accept and agree to the new terms of this Agreement, or, if you do not agree to the new terms, cease or terminate your use of the SDK. Your continued use of the SDK after changes to this Agreement take effect will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to a change, you must stop using the SDK and terminate this Agreement. Any termination of this Agreement by you under this Section 8 (and only this Section 8) will not affect your right, subject to your continued compliance with your obligations under this Agreement, to continue to distribute versions of your Application created and first distributed before termination, and will not affect the right of your End Users to continue using such versions of your Application, both of which rights will survive termination.
